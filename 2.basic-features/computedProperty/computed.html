            In the following text, by the word dependencies I refer to variables that are reactive and are used inside a
computed property. When a dependency is changed, the computed property is calculated.
Computed properties are not meant for memorizing data, but you can define a setter in case it makes more
sense to set a value directly instead of indirectly manipulating it through its dependencies. Moreover, if a
computed property returns an object, it will be a new object every time, not a modified version of the
previous one. Lastly, the computed property will not be called if all the dependencies haven't changed.

<!-- 
    Caching computed properties
While functions inside the methods option are executed every time we call them, functions in computed
are cached based on the dependencies, which in turn are defined by everything reactive found inside the
function.
In the next recipe, composing computed properties is explored, but you can easily imagine how you
can have very heavy calculations on a computed property:
computed: {
    trillionthDigitOfPi () {
        // hours of computations and terabytes later...
        return 2
    }
}
Then, you can use the same property over and over, without the need for re-evaluation at every usage:
    unnecessarilyComplexDoubler (input) {
        return input * this.trillionthDigitOfPi
    }
Every time we call this function, we just fetch the cached value of trillionthDigitOfPi; there is no need for
calculations again.
