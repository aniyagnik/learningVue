    Vue comes with no built-in filters except for an equivalent of the JSON filter. 
    This filter was very useful and, while its considered not really orthodox to debug with it,
    sometimes it just makes your life easier. Now we have it straight
    away without even writing it.

<!--
    Deprecation of array filters
If you had a lot of filtered v-for lists, I have bad news for you. Even if in the wild the most common use for
filters was with v-for, the community chose to remove this feature. The reason is mainly because having a
lot of filters, often piped together, was hard to reason about and thus to maintain.
The new recommended way to filter a list is with a computed property. Luckily for you, we have an entire
recipe on how to do that. See the recipe Filtering a list with a computed property in the next chapter.
